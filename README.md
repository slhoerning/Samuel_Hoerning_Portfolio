### About Me 
Hello! I am an experienced Sales Rep and Pharmaceutical professional with over 5 years of proven expertise in Pharmaceuticals and Weight Loss.

With skills in Microsoft 365, Data Analysis, Product Marketing, and Team Leadership, I am able to develop strategic sales plans, drive market penetration, and achieve consistent revenue growth across competitive territories. I am adept at using Salesforce CRM, Zendesk, and Excel for reporting and insights.

My dynamic skill set, commitment to customer-centric solutions, and passion for healthcare innovation position me as a valuable asset. In my spare time, I like to stay active with Rowing workouts and explore new culinary recipes.

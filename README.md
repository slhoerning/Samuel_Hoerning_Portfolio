 - Initial Project Idea:
I came up with this project to simplify tracking grades across multiple courses. I set out to solve the problem of manually calculating final grades, which can be confusing and time-consuming, especially with weighted assignments.

 - Tools I Used:
I used Microsoft Excel to build the grade calculator, incorporating formulas, percentage calculations, and pie charts to visually represent assignment weights and scores.

 - Challenges I Faced:
One challenge was ensuring the accuracy of weighted scores and correctly linking assignment weights to the final grade prediction. I overcame this by double-checking formulas and testing the calculator with sample data.

 - Other Resources:
I used online Excel tutorials to refine chart designs and formula building. I did not collaborate directly with anyone but referenced sample grade book templates for inspiration.

 - Result:
I set out to create a user-friendly, automated grade tracker, and I achieved it. If I were to improve it, I would add conditional formatting to alert users when their grade drops below a certain threshold.
